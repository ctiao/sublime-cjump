Sublime Cjump
=============

-This is a very simple and rough plugin for sublime text2/3.
-Install this plugin , you can open the next/previous file in the same folder of the current file  by pressing alt+PgDn and alt+PgUp.
-I'm a Python noob. I wrote it because I hadn't  found the plugin above mentioned.
-I believe it useful and remained to be developed,so I created this github Repository.


Installation
=============
*Launch sublime text 2 
*Preferences->Browse Packages
*Copy the "Cjump" folder to the opened dir
